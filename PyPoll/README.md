First, the necessary modules are imported: csv for reading the csv file, and os for accessing the file system.

Then, the file path for the csv file is set up using the os.path.join() function.

Several variables are initialized to hold the total number of votes, the number of votes each candidate received, and the name of the winning candidate.

The CSV file is opened and read using the csv.reader() method.

The first row of the CSV file (i.e., the header row) is skipped using the next() method.

A for loop is used to iterate over each row of the CSV file.

Within the loop, the total number of votes is incremented by 1 for each row, and the number of votes each candidate received is tallied using a dictionary called each_candidate_votes.

After the loop, another for loop is used to determine the winning candidate by comparing the number of votes each candidate received.

The results are then printed to the console using print() statements.

The same results are also written to a text file using the open() function and write() method.
