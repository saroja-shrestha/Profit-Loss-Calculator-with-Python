First, the necessary modules are imported: csv for reading the csv file, and os for accessing the file system.

Then, the file path for the csv file is set up using the os.path.join() function.

Several variables are initialized to keep track of important information: total_profit_loss to keep track of the total profit or loss, total_months to keep track of the total number of months, current_pl to keep track of the current profit or loss, change to keep track of the change in profit or loss from the previous month, date to keep track of the date for each row of data, and profits to keep track of the changes in profit or loss for each month.

The csv file is opened using the with open() statement, and the csv.DictReader() method is used to read the data. The first row of data is read and processed outside the loop.

Inside the loop, the date for the current row is added to the date list, and the change in profit or loss from the previous month is calculated and added to the profits list.

The total_months and total_profit_loss variables are updated for each row of data.

After processing all the data, the greatest increase and decrease in profits are calculated using the max() and min() functions, and the index of the corresponding date is found using the index() method. The dates and amounts of the greatest increase and decrease are stored in the variables greatest_date, greatest_increase, low_date, and greatest_decrease.

The average change in profit or loss between months is calculated by dividing the sum of the changes by the number of changes.

The results are printed to the terminal using formatted strings, and the results are also written to a text file using the with open() statement and the "w" mode.
